# Wealth_Ineqality_Shiny_App
Class project for DSBA 5122: Visual Analytics

Hey all, this is a Shiny App created with RStudio. The app is deployed on Shinyapps.io (https://imad3k.shinyapps.io/Final_Project/), please give it a visit.

The goal of this project was to take a dataset from Tidy Tuesday and try to recreate some of the charts presented.

Here we've taken the work submitted by Robert Walker on February, 9th, 2021 (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/readme.md).
The goal of his Tidy Tuesday project study was to recreate some of the charts from an article published by The Urban Institute (https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/). 

Please be free to download our R code and experiment. 


How to recreate the Shiny App:

1) Download all the files onto you computer, save them in a common folder.
2) Be sure to keep the folder structured "as is". The data files should go in the data folder. The shiny app file (App.R) should be in the "Wealth inequality App" folder.

To Begin: 
3) There is a Project file called "Wealth Inequality Shiny App.Rproj" - you want to start here and open this file.
4) It should automatically load 2 files within RStudio:  Get_the_data.R  &  App.R 
5) Get_the_data.R <- is the main R stript that modifies the data, creates variable names and so on. Run the complete file.
6) App.R <- is the Shiny App file. After you have run the "Get_the_data.R" script, simply click "Run App" within the App.R file. This should load the shiny app.
