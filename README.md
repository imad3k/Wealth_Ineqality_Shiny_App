# Wealth_Ineqality_Shiny_App
Class project for DSBA 5122: Visual Analytics

Hey all, this is a Shiny App created with RStudio. The app is deployed on Shinyapps.io (https://imad3k.shinyapps.io/Final_Project/), please give it a visit.

The goal of this project was to take a dataset from Tidy Tuesday and try to recreate some of the charts presented.

Here we've taken the work submitted by Robert Walker on February, 9th, 2021 (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/readme.md).
The goal of his Tidy Tuesday project study was to recreate some of the charts from an article published by The Urban Institute (https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/). 

Please be free to download our R code and experiment.
